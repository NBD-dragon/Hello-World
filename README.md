# Hello-World
The repository is for practicing the GitHub flow.
I am interested in computer science and learning programming. By formal training, I am an attorney with a PhD and presently the Dean of the College of Law at the American University of Iraq - Baghdad. 
I am using this file to practice how GitHub works.
